# Swift iOS

The goal of this repository is to curate a set of educational resources for developers interested in 
learning iOS development through the lens of the Swift programming language.

Ideally this won't become a dumping ground for every last blog post and tweet we stumble across, but rather
a course curriculum covering the best practices, the golden path, the way TWG aspires to build iOS applications.
